                    <p>
                        My name is Marvellous Chirenje, based in Boksburg, South Africa. I am a Software developer, 
                        who's experienced in taking fullstack applications from scratch to production.
                        Being a developer has always been my dream. I started doing computer lessons in 2002 when i was in Grade 8, my passion grew 
                        as i learnt more in the field. I have worked in Corporate and Hospitality offering admin services. 14years down the line 
                        decided to divert into Software Development. It is fulfilling, i love learning new things everyday. 
                        Now I enjoy bring my sense of imagination into reality through creating and designing.

                    <h3>
                        Specializations
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I also go by Full Stack Developer, Front-End Developer, or Back-End Developer.

With all that said, I don’t like to just define myself by the work I’ve done. My inspiration is boundless, it fuels me in the pursuit of cultivating new skills. My ability to juggle different projects and roles with relative ease is the key to my success.

Over the course of my life and career I have developed expertise in several areas of web development and design. I am seeking to continue this growth by opening myself for opportunities which are guaranteed to challenge me.
